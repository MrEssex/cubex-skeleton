# Contributing Guidelines
We welcome everyone to contribute towards this Project, but doing so will require you to follow specific rules to keep a consistent and welcoming way of contributing.

## Issues
Like any other project can you encounter bugs or a feature is missing for you in the plugin.  
For that, you can open an [issue] to report a bug, or suggest a new feature to be added.

When doing so, make sure you follow rules below:

### Follow the template
We have issue templates to help us get the required information more easily. Please follow the provided template when either filing a bug report or feature request.  
Your issue may be closed without warning for not following the template.

### No duplicate issue
Make sure that there aren't any existing issues relating to the problem, which are still open, or are closed with a solution/explanation.  
Opening a separate issue for a bug report or feature request, that already exists on the issue tracker only slows down the process of fixing the bug or implementing the feature.

If an issue with the bug or feature you want to report/suggest exists, comment on it with your info (bug reports) or give it a :thumbsup: (Feature Request) to show that this is important for you.
